#### Me at a glance

Aspiring full stack junior developer; amateur background in developing video-game plugins (+7 years); professional background in healthcare advertising (+5 years). Recently graduated from the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) bootcamp; excited to join a friendly, ambitious team that will support me as I continue to grow and improve as a developer.

#### How I got here

Through my self-taught hobby of developing video game plugins (aka mods), I discovered a love for wrestling with a programming language to bring ideas into reality. Dissatisfied with healthcare advertising, I left my Account Director role in 2021 to develop my hobby-acquired skills into a more fulfilling, stimulating and challenging career in software development.

After several months of self-directed learning, I joined [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to improve my amateur coding skills for use in a professional context, and to learn new skills and languages to make me a desirable candidate for a future employer. I am now ready for a junior developer role. I am determined and hungry for the challenge, and I am so excited to get started.

#### Featured Makers Challenges

During my time at Makers Academy, I completed several pair-programming and solo challenges. The ones I found particularly educational and enjoyable are listed here.
| Name | Aim | Description | Tech/Tools |
|--|--|--|--|
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/Zimmja/acebook-blue-magpies) | Group engineering challenge: use a framework to develop a full-stack web-app | A simple social media web-app based on Facebook which allowed users to create a basic profile and comment on other users' profiles | Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, PostgreSQL, Rspec, Rubocop, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap|
| [**Banking**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Bank) | Solo technical challenge: write well-crafted code to solve a technical problem | Wrote easily readable, understandable, and editable code for making transactions with a bank account using a REPL. Coach reviewed, passed on first attempt and then refined | JavaScript, Node, Jest, Prettier |
| [**Bowling**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Bowling-JS) | Solo challenge: solve a technical problem and convert code from one language to another | Created a scoring card for a bowling game using Ruby (a deceptively difficult task requiring solid planning and execution), and then converted to JavaScript | JavaScript, Ruby, Node, Jest, Rspec |
| [**Thermostat**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Thermostat) | Pairing challenge: create and test-drive a simple JavaScript program using Node | We created a thermostat that could be interacted with via the command line and utilise API calls from OpenWeather to receive and display real-world info | JavaScript, Node, Jest, APIs |
| [**RPS Game**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-RPS) | Solo challenge: create a game that is playable in a web browser | Tasked with creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) style game. Finished quickly and was able to stretch myself to a 16-item game (instead of the 3-item RPS game) | Ruby, Sinatra, Capybara, Selenium Webdriver, HTML, CSS, Rspec, Rubocop|

### Professional skills

#### Communication

Exceptional written and verbal communication skills; understanding and responding to client goals and issues was an essential part of my role at LAB. In one example, I rapidly responded to a prospective client's verbal and written briefs with an insightful, well-written, comprehensive action plan of such an exceptional standard that she skipped the usual procurement process and hired LAB outright, replacing her then-current agency with no pitch required. During the Makers Academy final project, excellent team communication made pair-programming much easier and helped us resolve different (sometimes conflicting) ideas for the web-app's final functionality.

#### Adaptability

When the medical review system, [Veeva Vault](https://www.veeva.com/products/enterprise-content-management/), was launched across the healthcare advertising industry, I quickly adapted to it and developed processes for my agency, LAB, to use it. This allowed LAB to approve advertisments faster than other agencies. Clients recognised LAB as Veeva experts, and I was asked personally to teach other agencies how to use it. Similarly, during my final project at Makers, my fast uptake of both ReactJS and Express (which I learnt myself as they were not taught on the course) helped me plan the structure of our web-app and tackle the hardest coding challenges of the project under a tight timeline.

#### Problem solving

Proven track record of combining different skillsets to solve problems. In one example while at LAB, I saved a colleague's account from leaving our agency by single-handedly solving a multidisciplinary presentation problem that required my skills in graphic design, writing and science literacy. In my hobby of video game plugin development, I developed my own methods for solving code errors, which I have since improved at Makers Academy to become a competent debugger.

#### Attention to detail

Proofing skills noted as impressive by clients while at LAB. Detail-orientation has been essential to my success in video game plugin development, helping me create comprehensive content changes supported by fully-documented descriptions. At both LAB and Makers Academy, I have found my attention to detail invaluable in producing robust plans, predicting (and avoiding) issues, and spotting mistakes.
